### TripAdvisor Clone

This project is a front-end clone of TripAdvisor, built using advanced HTML and CSS. The aim was to recreate the look and feel of the popular travel website, focusing on responsive design, layout precision, and CSS styling techniques. 

**Features:**
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Advanced CSS:** Utilizes modern CSS features such as Flexbox, Grid, and custom animations for a dynamic and engaging user interface.
- **Pixel-Perfect Layouts:** Ensures visual accuracy by closely matching the original design, with attention to details like typography, spacing, and colors.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Tested across multiple browsers to ensure consistent performance and appearance.
